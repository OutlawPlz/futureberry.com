<p>Here's who Futureberry is: (def da mettere insieme con risultati typeform)</p>

<p>In this place we talk a lot, eat a lot, create paths of transformation and change, listen to music, organize parties, encourage people and therefore companies to be more free and creative.</p>

<p>We like to call ourselves a “liberation army” in the sense that we pursue the mission of freeing people in organizations, changing spaces, ways of working and breaking the usual routines. We work on new challenges every day to make people more aware and creators of transformation.</p>

<p>We are in continuous revolution which brings changes in what we do but also in the way we work. Today we are testing a flat organizational structure: we are divided into bands, squads and work gangs, each person comes from a different study backgrounds and puts his qualities and skills at the service of others.</p>

<p>We gave us some rules to be freer. We have called them “smart actions” which help us to put our values into practice.</p>

<p>We love to travel, we are constantly exploring and listening to the people we work with.</p>

<p>We create futureberry internal projects through which we bring passions and interests into the office.</p>

<p>If you want to work with us we do not exclude that in the transformation process we will can participate to a boxing match, we can become a pastry chef for an afternoon or maybe we will be the protagonist of an exhibition.</p>

<p>We want our work to generate impact also outside our organization.</p>

<p>We work with a Fuwera approach:</p>

<ul>
	<li>FUN: we have fun with people we work with.</li>
	<li>WEIRD: we try to be authentic in our actions and in our work even if we could look like strange.</li>
	<li>RADICAL: we need to understand the impact that we are generating.</li>
</ul>
