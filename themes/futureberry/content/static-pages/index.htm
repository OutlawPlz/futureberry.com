<p><strong>At Futureberry we chat, we eat (a lot), we create paths of transformation and change, we listen to music, we organise parties, we encourage the liberation of people within their organisation (and in turn the organisation itself) for freedom and creativity.</strong></p>

<p><strong>We are a “<span class="keyword" data-video_url="http://127.0.0.1:8000/storage/app/media/68589146_714724298970198_7544570326798903743_n.mp4"><span class="keyword__label">Liberation Army</span><a class="keyword__link" href="https://www.google.com/">Google</a></span>” who works within organisations by shaking up workspaces, processes, methodologies and daily routines. We don’t stop until the organisation and the people within it are, well... liberated.</strong></p>

<p><strong>We don’t just fight to liberate other organisations. We also fight ourselves, for liberation. Daily, we negotiate our internal revolution to continuously evolve what we do and how we do it. Annually, we new organisational structures and approaches to our work. We even make rules. Rules that help us work freer, which we call “Smart Actions” that help us stay aligned with our values.</strong></p>

<p><strong>We have open holidays. To take a year off or to go to that event overseas that you’ve wanted to attend. We keep our ears to the ground, exploring our everyday and learning from those who we work with. We create internal projects to ignite and invigorate the passions and interests of our people.</strong></p>

<p><strong>We want to make a difference by creating things that provide value to people not just within but also outside of the organisations that we work with.</strong></p>

<p><strong>We won’t lie. The fight for liberation, the fight we’ll face together, may manifest in ways you wouldn’t expect. You may find yourself putting on gloves and entering the ring, elbow-deep kneading dough at a bakery or even front and centre playing the lead role in a play.</strong></p>

<p><strong>This unpredictability may have something to do with our&nbsp;fuwera&nbsp;approach that define how we operate at Futureberry</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>FUN&nbsp;- We have fun at work and so do the people who work with us.</strong></li>
	<li><strong>WEIRD&nbsp;- Good, bad or ugly we are completely authentic, even if to some, we may seem strange.</strong></li>
	<li><strong>RADICAL&nbsp;- We only do work that makes a dramatic impact.</strong></li>
	<li><strong>PIZZA AND FIGS - We sing and we dance together. No word of a lie, we have a guitar in the office and a big wall mural of all of our faces. Further to this, we swear to you that everything you read above is the truth.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>We’R’Fun</strong>
